# Fraud Detection Model - Machine Learning / Data Analysis

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions from a dataset of user transactions. The goal is to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate and report any detected frauds. 

The model has been developed and tested using Jupyter notebooks, leveraging various machine learning techniques and data analysis methods.

## Key Features
- **Transaction Classification**: Identifies whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Fraud Reporting**: Flags and reports fraudulent transactions for further action.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes A/B testing and mistake analysis to evaluate model performance.

## Tasks & Approach

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Data was collected from transaction logs and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorization.
- Feature engineering was performed to improve the accuracy of fraud detection.

### 2. Model Training
- Various machine learning algorithms were applied to detect fraud, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- Model hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

### 3. A/B Testing
- **Objective**: Compare two versions of the fraud detection model to determine which one performs better.
- **Method**: Randomly split the data into two groups, apply different models, and compare the results based on performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 4. Mistakes Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze false positives (incorrectly flagged as fraud) and false negatives (missed frauds) to improve the model.
- **Method**: Review flagged transactions and missed frauds, and apply further feature engineering or model tuning based on the analysis.

## Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection.git
    cd fraud-detection
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    Open the Jupyter notebook in your browser:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. **Test A/B models**:
    To compare two different fraud detection models, run the respective cells that implement the A/B testing.

5. **Evaluate Results**:
    Look at the confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the models.
